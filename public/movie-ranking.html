<h1>The Best Movies Ever Made</h1>
<h2>According to Alex</h2>

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>Russell Crowe is legendary in this one. Very quotable, great music, and story that is overwhelmingly human amidst such grandeur</p>
<h3>Italian Job (Newer)</h3>
<p>Honestly, just a fun, exciting watch. Cast is great and the story is perfectly self aware but sincere.</p>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>If anything, it's the music for me. It's audibly and visually stunning.</p>
